  - Clear data presentation
  - Input validation for data integrity

## System Design

- **Object-Oriented Architecture**
  - `Book` class encapsulates all book properties
  - Separate header/implementation files for clean organization

- **File Operations**
  - CSV parsing using string streams
  - Memory-efficient loading with `vector<Book>`
  - Atomic save operations prevent data corruption

- **Core Components**
  - `Book.h/cpp`: Data model and display logic
  - `Library.h/cpp`: File I/O and business logic
  - `main.cpp`: User interface and program flow
